## üî• Matchmaking Innovation

### **Smart Skill-Based Matchmaking**
Instead of just rating, we use:

3. **Time Zone**: Prefer local players for better ping
4. **Learning Goals**: Match with complementary styles

### **The "Find Your Rival" System**
```typescript
interface RivalMatch {
  similarRating: boolean;      // Within 50 points
  oppositStyle: boolean;       // Tactical vs Positional
  closeGames: number;          // History of close matches
  mutualAvailability: boolean; // Play at similar times
}
```

    .filter(p => Math.abs(p.rating - player.rating) < 200)
    .filter(p => p.preferredTimeControl === player.preferredTimeControl)
    .filter(p => !player.blockedUsers.includes(p.id))
    .sort((a, b) => {
      // Prioritize good ping
      const pingScoreA = getPingScore(player, a);
      const pingScoreB = getPingScore(player, b);
      
      // Consider play style diversity
      const styleScoreA = getStyleMatchScore(player, a);
      const styleScoreB = getStyleMatchScore(player, b);
