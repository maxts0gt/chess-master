By castling, you've moved your king away from the center where it could be attacked, and you've also brought your rook into the game. This is especially smart in the current position because your opponent has active pieces that could have threatened your king. Now your king is tucked away safely behind a wall of pawns, and you can focus on your attack!",
        "Smart castling move! This shows you understand the importance of getting your king to safety before the position opens up. Notice how this also connects your rooks, which is crucial for controlling the back rank. Many beginners forget to castle and pay the price later - but not you! This move sets you up nicely for the middlegame.",

But this isn't just about counting pieces - notice how this capture also improves your position. The ${moveObj.piece} is now more active, and you've removed one of your opponent's key pieces. In chess, every exchange should improve your position somehow, and this one definitely does!`,
        `Good tactical awareness! This capture of the ${moveObj.captured} demonstrates that you're actively looking for opportunities to win material. What's particularly nice about this capture is that it's completely safe - your ${moveObj.piece} can't be recaptured disadvantageously. Remember, winning material is one of the most reliable ways to win games!`,

        "Check! This is a powerful move that forces your opponent to respond immediately. By putting the king in check, you're taking control of the game's tempo - your opponent must deal with the threat before doing anything else. This is a great example of using forcing moves to your advantage. Look at how limited your opponent's options are now!",
        "Excellent use of check to gain initiative! This isn't just checking for the sake of it - you're using the check to improve your position. While your opponent deals with the king threat, you'll be able to follow up with even stronger moves. This is how masters play - using forcing moves to implement their plans!",

This piece is now controlling important squares and working together with your other pieces. Remember the opening principles: develop your pieces, control the center, and castle early. You're following them perfectly!",
        "This is textbook development! By bringing this piece out, you're not just developing - you're developing with a purpose. Notice how this piece eyes important central squares and coordinates well with your other pieces. This is how strong players build their positions - piece by piece, each move improving their overall coordination.",

In the long term, this pawn might even become a passed pawn. Every pawn move is a commitment since pawns can't go backwards, and you've chosen wisely here!",

Understanding when and how to push pawns is what separates intermediate players from beginners, and you're showing that understanding!",
