- Tiny LLM experiments (ONNX)
- Multiple explanation tiers
- Complex fallback logic

### AFTER: Best-in-Class
- Stockfish 17.1 (world's best, <200ms)
- Mistral 7B (ChatGPT-quality, offline)
- No fallbacks needed - it just works

## 💰 Monetization

### BEFORE: Unclear
- No defined model
- Complex feature gates
- Server dependencies

### AFTER: Crystal Clear
- Free: Unlimited play + 3 coach/day
- Pro ($14.99 once): Unlimited coach
- Platform IAP with restore
