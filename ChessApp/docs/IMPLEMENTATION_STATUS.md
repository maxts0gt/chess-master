# Implementation Status: Chess App Revamp

## ✅ Phase 1: Clean Architecture (COMPLETED)

### What We've Done:
1. **Removed all complexity**
   - Deleted 17 screens
   - Removed Ollama service
   - Removed Tiny LLM experiments
   - Removed custom chess AI
   - Cleaned up package.json

2. **Created ultra-simple architecture**
   - Single App.tsx with 3 views (home, play, coach)
   - Two giant buttons on home screen
   - Stockfish service stub
   - Coach service stub

3. **Current structure:**
```
ChessApp/
├── App.tsx (ultra-simple 2-button interface)
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── ChessBoard.tsx (existing)
│   │   └── CoachView.tsx (new simple coach)
│   └── services/
│       ├── stockfishService.ts (GM-level engine)

## 📱 App Philosophy

**Old**: Feature-rich, complex, server-dependent
**New**: Two things done perfectly - Play & Learn

The app is now radically simplified. Users can:
1. Tap "PLAY NOW" → Instant chess game
2. Tap "ASK COACH" → Get explanations

That's it. No menus, no settings, no friction.
